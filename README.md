Project Overview

The objective of this project was to conduct sentiment analysis using a dataset of US airline tweets. The analysis includes data preprocessing, implementation of machine learning models, and handling class imbalance with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Key milestones include data collection, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results, leading to insights into airline customer feedback.

Results

The project successfully applied sentiment analysis techniques to classify tweets about US airlines. The model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. SMOTE was implemented to mitigate the effects of class imbalance in the dataset, improving the model’s ability to correctly classify minority classes.
